                            At the end of 2023, I started working on my first SaaS, writing code non-stop for an entire year. I was so focused on building it that I never thought about how I would reach users. When it was finally time to launch, I asked myself, ‚ÄúHow do I show the world what I‚Äôve created?‚Äù I tried social media, then writing blog articles‚Ä¶ but nothing worked.

                </div>
                <div className='w-full flex flex-col items-start justify-start gap-6 text-start text-zinc-500'>
                    <p>
                        Then, one day, I randomly discovered Reddit. I started posting without expecting much and‚Ä¶ BOOM! Some of my posts got 10K, 20K views. I thought I had finally found the key, but I soon realized it was just luck. Those posts happened to be in the right place at the right time, and I had no control over it. So, on a boring Friday night, with too much caffeine still in my system, I thought: ‚ÄúWhat if I could create my own luck?‚Äù

                        That weekend, I started building postonreddit, and everything changed. My posts no longer relied on luck but on a solid strategy. I learned how to make the most of Reddit, finally attracting users to my SaaS and meeting amazing people from all over the world.
