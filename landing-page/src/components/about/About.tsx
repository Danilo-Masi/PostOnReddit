                    Hey, it's Danilo ðŸ‘‹
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Back in 2018, I thought I could be the next Mark Zuckerberg. I built a startup for a year, but it didn't go as planned, and I ended up with no users...
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    After a few tough years, I decided to approach things differently. I learned from my failures, took things step by step, and now, I'm excited to have launched postonreddit. It's been a journey of growth, and I'm finally on a path that feels right.
