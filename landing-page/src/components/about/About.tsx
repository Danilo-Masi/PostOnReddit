                    Hey, it's Danilo ðŸ‘‹
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In 2018, I believed I was Mark Zuckerberg, built a startup for 1 year, and got 0 users...
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    A few years after my burnout, I restarted the journey differently: I shipped like a madmanâ€”16 startups in 2 years. Now I'm happy and earn $45,000 a month.
